###Intro:
At the end of every day we are going to give you guys time for independent study. There will always be labs on Learn.co that you can work on but a couple of other projects that you might want to consider are:

+ Set up an online portfolio to show off your work. Here are some examples:
  * http://marisaposter.com/ 
  * http://catherinecodes.com/  
  * http://mitchboyer.com/ 
  * http://randallreedjr.com/portfolio/ 

Start blogging about your experience. Writing about what you are learning here is a great way to solidify the concepts, share your experience and build your online presence.
